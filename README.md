# SearchTask
its an app that seaches the CSV file given to me.
The user types a word and the app automatically searches the csv file for the mathing data.
##Demo
###Case 1
######1 - app is launched
######2 - app will show currently stored data( in this case the inventory csv file)
######3 - click the money chip and the currently shown data is sorted by price (lowest to largest)
###Case 2
######1 - click the search bar two extra buttons will show up default All is selected by deafult
######2 - type any word(example os) and you should see results
######3 - click the money chip and the currently shown data is sorted by price (lowest to largest)
###Case 3
######1 - click the search bar two extra buttons will show up
######2 - click on the Category button
######3 - type any word(example wome) and you should see reasults based in the inputed word
######4 - click the money chip and the currently shown data is sorted by price (lowest to largest)
##for the future
######1 - I would like to have created a custom search bar with my own buttons and design
######2 - I would have the data in a databse and make request to it rather then use the csv file
######3 - I would like put more time into this so i can fiz some issues that occur.
  The issue being that if a user clicks the search bar and types nothing but clicks the money ship then nothing is sorted
